# USE CASE: 33 Implement Country Data Function

## CHARACTERISTIC INFORMATION

**Goal in Context**  
As a software developer, I want to implement a function that includes the columns Code, Name, Continent, Region, Population, and Capital so that the system can produce consistent and accurate country-based reports for data analysts, researchers, and policy makers.

**Scope**  
Global Data Reporting System.

**Level**  
Primary task.

**Preconditions**
- Developer has access to the country dataset or database.
- Data source includes fields for Code, Name, Continent, Region, Population, and Capital.
- Development environment and repository are properly set up.

**Success End Condition**
- The function is successfully implemented and integrated into the system.
- Data analysts, researchers, and policy makers can use it to generate accurate country-based reports.

**Failed End Condition**
- The function is not implemented, or data is incomplete/inaccurate, preventing proper report generation.

**Primary Actor**  
Software Developer.

**Trigger**  
A requirement from the project or product owner to create standardized country data output for reports.

## MAIN SUCCESS SCENARIO

1. Developer creates a new function in the systemâ€™s codebase.
2. Developer defines data columns: Code, Name, Continent, Region, Population, and Capital.
3. The function retrieves and structures country data from the database or dataset.
4. The function validates that all fields are populated and formatted correctly.
5. Developer tests the function to ensure accuracy and consistency.
6. The function is committed to the repository and integrated with the reporting module.
7. The system produces consistent and accurate country-based reports.

## EXTENSIONS

- **Data source missing fields:** Developer logs an error and requests updated data.
- **Data validation fails:** Function returns an error message or flags problematic records.
- **Integration issue:** Developer troubleshoots and ensures the function works with the reporting module.
