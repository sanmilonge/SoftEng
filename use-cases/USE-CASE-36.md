# USE CASE: 36 Implement Population Distribution Function

## CHARACTERISTIC INFORMATION

**Goal in Context**  
As a developer, I want to implement a function that includes the columns Name of the continent, region, or country; total population; population living in cities (including %); and population not living in cities (including %), so that the system can produce clear and reliable population distribution reports for data analysts, researchers, and policy makers.

**Scope**  
Global Data Reporting System.

**Level**  
Primary task.

**Preconditions**
- Developer has access to population data for continents, regions, and countries.
- Data source includes information on total population and urban vs. non-urban population.
- Development environment and repository are properly configured.

**Success End Condition**
- The function is successfully implemented and integrated into the system.
- Data analysts, researchers, and policy makers can use it to generate accurate population distribution reports.

**Failed End Condition**
- The function is not implemented, or data is incomplete/inaccurate, preventing correct population distribution reporting.

**Primary Actor**  
Software Developer.

**Trigger**  
A requirement from the project or product owner to create standardized population distribution data for reporting and analysis.

## MAIN SUCCESS SCENARIO

1. Developer creates a new function in the systemâ€™s codebase.
2. Developer defines data columns: Name of the continent, region, or country; total population; population living in cities (including %); and population not living in cities (including %).
3. The function retrieves and structures population data from the database or dataset.
4. The function calculates urban and non-urban population percentages for each area.
5. The function validates that all fields are accurate and formatted correctly.
6. Developer tests the function to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
7. The function is committed to the repository and integrated into the reporting module.
8. The system produces clear and reliable population distribution reports.

## EXTENSIONS

- **Missing population data:** Developer logs an error and requests updated data from the data source.
- **Incorrect percentage calculations:** The function flags and recalculates data for affected records.
- **Integration issues:** Developer debugs the function to ensure compatibility with the reporting system.
